## Hello ðŸ‘‹
I am a French student who loves everything about new technologies and programming! It's been about 5 years since I started coding. 
During this time, I've learned technologies such as:
- Unity and C#
- Basics of Python
- Elementary languages for the web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- ...

I'm currently trying to learn Godot and automate tasks with Python to save time. I also create french videos with friends about video games [TRIKAPA](https://www.youtube.com/@Trikapa)

- My portfolio [(not finished)](https://deadmall0w.github.io/)
- Python script to retrieve my homework [Devoir-ENT](https://github.com/DeadMall0w/Devoir-ENT)
- My Discord bot (not finished) [DeadMabot](https://github.com/DeadMall0w/DeadMabot)

- Ascii maze in C# [C-sharp-asciil-maze](https://github.com/DeadMall0w/C-sharp-asciil-maze)

## What I want to learn in the future
- English

- Linux/Ubuntu/...
- C++ and C
