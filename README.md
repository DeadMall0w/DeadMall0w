## Hello ðŸ‘‹
I am a French student who loves everything about new technologies and programming! It's been about 5 years since I started coding. 
During this time, I've learned technologies such as:
- Unity and C#
- Basics of Python
- Elementary languages for the web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- ...

I'm currently trying to learn Godot and automate tasks with Python to save time. I also create videos with friends about video games [TRIKAPA](https://www.youtube.com/@Trikapa)

## Some of my projects
- My portfolio (not finished)
- Python script to retrieve my homework
- My Discord bot (not finished)
- My website for learning in schools

## What I want to learn in the future
- English
- Godot
- Linux/Ubuntu/...
- C++ and C
